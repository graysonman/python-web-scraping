Tool to update pricing 

# How to use:
1. Install chrome driver and then open a tab of the driver. Use terminal or cmd to start the driver with any of the given parameters you want.
2. You will need to edit the code to fit the xpath as well as the site to get the product pricing or where it will put the pricing.
3. Once you have edited the code you can start it and it will grab the open application and start doing the updates.

# Note:
If you have anything that does not load the program will close out. IE webpage doesn't load in the time given by wait it will just crash.
If you run the program with the web browser not fully maximized or open on a monitor it can give weird crash errors that do not happen when it is open.... It does not need to be the primary window though.
